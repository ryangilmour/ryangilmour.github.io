## Employment
### GE Vernova - Solutions Specialist (Jan 2023 ‚Äì May 2024)

Working as part of the services delivery team to deliver highly-available DERMS grid management software to utilities across the world. I worked throughout all of the project phases from design and implementation through to customer Go-Live. This requires a broad understanding of customer cyber-security, networking and power systems modelling experience. My key contributions were:

#### Energy Systems Modelling

- Leading all technical aspects of a long-term vehicle-to-grid (V2G) impact study, using the GE Simulation module to study a client‚Äôs network when deploying electric vehicles (EVs) with and without optimal control.
- Creating, documenting, and performing test cases on the GE Forecasting module: using Machine Learning algorithms to train models and testing the product‚Äôs scalability (using Kubernetes).
- Being the subject matter expert across Forecasting, Simulation and Optimization modules and interfacing with the relevant product teams to influence product development to support customer use cases.

#### Software Development

- Developing a custom Python microservice to integrate the GE Forecasting with REST APIs to ingest customer live and historic Solar PV measurement data and NOAA weather data. 
- Defining agile working processes for a new Services Engineering team (8x full time staff).
- Issue estimation, sprint planning and code review using the GitLab toolset. 
- Delivering technical workshops surrounding renewable integration challenges, CIM and APIs.
- Acting as a technical interface between developers and the Solutions team.



### ZUoS Ltd. ‚Äì Simulations Lead (Aug 2021 ‚Äì Jan 2023)

Leading the development of the ZUoS Simulations platform, the company‚Äôs core software product. ZUoS Simulations supports the design and optimal planning of Smart Local Energy Systems to reach net zero. My role was to lead the architectural design and product roadmap of the solution. I was also heavily involved in utilising the platform for consultancy engagements and defining how consultants would leverage the platform for energy systems modelling. I worked actively with clients to understand their use cases for the product. Internally, I led the technical team to simulate decarbonisation pathways to understand in detail the economic, environmental, and network-level impacts of low-carbon technology deployment scenarios. My key contributions were: 

#### Energy Systems Modelling

- Leading all aspects of the technical delivery for projects on the Scottish Islands and with multiple Distribution System Operators(DSOs) to investigate how low carbon technologies (heat pumps, electric vehicles and battery energy storage) can reduce network impacts. 
- Creating digital twins of distribution networks using GIS and network planning input data.
- Providing demonstrations of ZUoS Simulations to prospective clients including network operators, energy generators and energy modelling consultants. 
- Communicating project progress to stakeholders via presentations and written reports.

#### Software Development

- Collaborating to define the systems architecture and product use cases for the platform.
- Issue estimation, sprint planning and code review using the GitHub toolset. 
- Co-developing the core optimization module for ZUoS alongside academic researchers.
- Developing a diversity module to support running probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations.
- Providing engineering input and documentation for physical energy asset modelling.
- Designing and implementing database schemas for time series results using SQLAlchemy.
- Developing models of energy demand and user preferences from trial datasets using machine learning methods across heat, transport and power.



### Scene Connect Ltd. ‚Äì Electrical Engineer, Renewables (Jan 2018 ‚Äì Jan 2023)

Working as part of a small team supporting community energy groups all the way from feasibility study to build out of renewable energy assets. This included grid connection studies for Solar PV, Wind and Battery Energy storage as well as geospatial mapping and energy modelling. My role involved delivering technical and non-technical reports and presentations across  innovation projects and engineering consultancy engagements. 


## Volunteering 
Volunteering is important to me. I find it rewarding to work with young people to teach them new skills, whether that is software/computing skills or outdoor skills. 

**Code Club Aotearoa (Current):** I help to run a weekly workshop which teaches young people (aged 8-12) basic programming using Scratch and micro-bits. 

**President at Engineering For Change (2018):** Managing a student society promoting sustainable and humanitarian development locally and internationally. Projects included: Missing Maps ‚ÄúMapathons‚Äù; building a wind turbine; building Solar PV panels; educational STEM workshops. 


**Scouts (2011-2014; 2018)** I have volunteered over the course of a few years with the Scouts, working across the Beavers, Cubs and Scouts sections. I was a Scout myself and hope to become a leader again down the line. 

**Camp America (2015):** Volunteering as part of a team of 6 to teach young people outdoor skills (e.g. open fire cooking, survival skills & most importantly campfire songs)


## Hobbies
An insight into what keeps me busy outside of work. Feel free to skip. 

**Hockey:** I play field hockey and have done for a number of years. I used to be a bit more serious about it, playing multiple times a week, but now I play in a mid-week league mostly for a good run around. 

**Rock Climbing:** I caught the bouldering and climbing bug through university and now go to the bouldering gym a few times a week. I've done a limited amount of outdoor climbing, but absolutely love it. 

**Hiking and Camping:** I try to get on the hills as much as I can. I'll happily take type one fair weather walking or type two Scottish weather hiking.

**Cooking:** When I have the time I love cooking. Roasted aubergine curry or banana bread are two go to highlights.

**Travelling:** I love travelling. I spent my exchange year during university in Singapore and managed to see a lot of South East Asia. I have some cognitive dissonance about travelling and climate change and I try to minimise my CO2 footprint when travelling. This means I've seen a lot of Scotland (where I am originally from) and New Zealand (where I currently live), and I'm learning to appreciate the slow lane. Previously going from Scotland to Europe has been made easier by having an employer on the brilliant [climate perks scheme](https://www.climateperks.com/).

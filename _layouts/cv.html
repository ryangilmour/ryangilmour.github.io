<em>This is an online version of my CV. For a more portable version, you can <a href="/CV.pdf" download="Ryan-Gilmour-CV">download it as a PDF here.</a> Some sections below (e.g. volunteering and hobbies) expand a bit beyond my PDF CV to give you an idea of what motivates me. Feel free to skip past those as you wish.</em>
